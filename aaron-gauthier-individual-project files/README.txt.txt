Throughout this project I did multiple things including a lot of research on music generation which includes:
-recommending the model to be use
-looking up various types of music and artists
-providing input into the report - wrote the introduction and the introduction of the project proposal
-wrote the slides for experimental results and conclusion
-created multiple files of melodies and two hands stacked files - music generation
-tested and help optimize the code to ensure there was no mistakes - found many bugs that were correct
-other things that I am certain I cannot remember

Best,
