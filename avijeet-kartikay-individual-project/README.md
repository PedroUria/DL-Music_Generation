The experience of doing this project has allowed me to,

- Understand various methods to encode the data 
- Understand music and its notations
- Experiment on various approaches
- Understand the limitations of generating sequences of musical notes/chords/rests

Individual work:

- Experiments with keras
- Tried to encode the musical data into single values

Results:
- The results of my experiment were inconsequential and useless as they were not meaningful

Code:
46% of the unused code
