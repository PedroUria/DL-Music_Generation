This subdirectory will contain all the data we will use to train our models. 

We mainly focused on the music under [classical](classical), because it was the one that contained the best quality of `.mid` files. They were downloaded from [this site](http://piano-midi.de/), and contains classical piano pieces organized by genre, author and style.   

The quaility of the MIDI files found in the internet can be very bad, as there are programs that convert from audio to MIDI, but they do not work very well. The owner of the sources site mentions the following:

> How do I go about finding a certain classical work in MIDI format in the Internet?
Some MIDI archives in the Internet contain thousands of classical works. You can find the corresponding links to them on my [Linkpage](http://piano-midi.de/links.htm). **The quality of the pieces, however, may vary considerably**.

 TODO: Aaron, describe your data a bit.
