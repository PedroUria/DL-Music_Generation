This folder contains one of the approaches we used, documented on [training\_many\_deff\_two\_voices\_dict.py](../../code/training_many_deff_two_voices_dict.py) and explained on the project report.

To reproduce results, use [training\_many\_deff\_two\_voices\_dict.py](../../code/training_many_deff_two_voices_dict.py) and copy paste the code written on the corresponding `.txt` file. You can also play with the generation using the generative functions inside this script.
