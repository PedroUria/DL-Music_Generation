This subdirectory contains some of the pieces we generated using the code in this repo. Each folder is dedicated to a particular approach, and both the pieces, the networks used to generate them [saved](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html) as a `.pkl` files and a small `.txt` that contains the code needed to reproduce the piece is provided. All of them share the same name with, in order to easely identify them and so that we do not create too many folders. These trained networks can be used to generate new pieces by simply inputing them different notes/sequences of notes, and also playing with the generative functions located on the scripts used to train them (on [code](../code)).
