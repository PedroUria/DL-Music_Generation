This folder contains one of the approaches we used, documented on [training\_many\_deff\_two\_voices.py](../../code/training_many_deff_two_voices.py) and explained on the project report. This was our first attempt and obviously there is something wrong with it, which is also explained in the report.

To reproduce results, use [training\_many\_deff\_two\_voices.py](../../code/training_many_deff_two_voices.py) and copy paste the code written on the corresponding .txt file. You can also play with the generation using the generative functions inside this script.
